## Generic Model Order Reduction Technique Based On Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm 

This is the MATLAB implementation of the document " A Generic Model Order Reduction Technique Based
On Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm " published by 	[Khaled Salah](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8011103/?reload=true "Khaled Salah") .

The code is made to reduce the transfer function of order 10 to order 2.
